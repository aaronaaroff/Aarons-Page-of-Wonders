    <h2>I swear he's really pretty nice</h2>

    <p>Aaron is really a great addition to anything you could really imagine:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>He's blindly loyal, if you offer food and water he will do almost anything...<strong>almost</strong>.</li>
      <li>He's also fiercely independent in which he shows within all of his work and creations, because only Aaron would create a static html page of "wonders" and only Aaron would find it truly funny.</li>
      <li>Cleans up all of his dishes right after use, none of the "just letting it soak for a bit" hooplah.</li>
    </ol>
